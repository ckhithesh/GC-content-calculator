# GC-content-calculator
GC percentage can be calculated using the attached python script. 

Dependencies: Python2 or higher. Biopython

GC-content is the percentage of nitrogenous bases that are either guanine (G) or cytosine (C) in a DNA or RNA molecule. This measure indicates the proportion of G and C bases out of an implied four total bases, also including adenine and thymine in DNA and adenine and uracil in RNA.
In DNA sequence, The total number Cytosine and Guanine bases in the sequence can be calculated by formula:

GC % = Total number of G's + Total number of C's / A+T+G+C * 100

Features of GC content:

    GC content acts as the main factor in evolutionary process in bacteria.
    Guanine and Cytocine is strongly bonded by Hydrogen bonds in DNA and RNA.
    Stability of the genome can be determined using GC content of an organism.
